# File Search Script

This Python script is designed to help you search for files on your device's hard drive.
It traverses through directories and allows you to find files based on their name or file extension.
Additionally, it provides information about the last access date and time of each file.
This program is useful when you need to locate files that you may have forgotten the location of,
have only partial name knowledge, or want to search for specific file types.

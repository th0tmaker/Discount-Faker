Program takes a custom amount of user inputs as strings and formats them into a list view of two types. 
First, the user is prompted to supply every input they wish to format. Once the user is satisfied with the amount of
inputs they would like to format, they can move to the next stage of the program by submitting an empty input string.
The program then asks the user to choose how they would like their text inputs formatted. Pressing and submitting 'n' turns
the text inputs into a numbered list, while pressing and submitting 'b' turns text inputs into a bullet point style list.
